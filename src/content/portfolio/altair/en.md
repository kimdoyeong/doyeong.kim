When I was held on this project is 2016, and I was 12-years-old.

Altair is a wiki engine made of PHP. I used PHP and MySQL on this project. Unfortunately, I can't run this project because DB Schema does not exist now.

I wrote this project with MVC Pattern. I referenced [XpressEngine](https://github.com/xpressengine/xpressengine), the most popular CMS in South Korea at the time.

Through this project, I learned how to develop a Web Project structurally.
