Altair is wiki engine made of PHP. I used PHP and MySQL on this project. Unfortunately, I can't run this project because DB Schema does not exist in this time.

I wrote this project with MVC Pattern. I referenced [XpressEngine](https://github.com/xpressengine/xpressengine), the most popular CMS in South Korea at the time.

Though this project, I learned develop Web Project structuredly.
