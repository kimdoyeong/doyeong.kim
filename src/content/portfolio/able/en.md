Able is a voice recognition browser for the blind. This project awarded the 2019 Seoul Creative Award. With two team members, I did Front-end Engineering for ‘visiable’, an ‘Action’ deploy service and Back-end Engineering.

I used Koa, MongoDB, Mongoose in Server and React, Next.js in ‘Visiable’ service.

After I developed this service, I learned about collaboration with other platforms (like Android) and I was concerned about web accessibility.
